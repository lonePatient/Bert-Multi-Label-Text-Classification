    # Arguments
        monitor: quantity to be monitored.
        min_delta: minimum change in the monitored quantity
            to qualify as an improvement, i.e. an absolute
            change of less than min_delta, will count as no
            improvement.
        patience: number of epochs with no improvement
            after which training will be stopped.
        verbose: verbosity mode.
        mode: one of {auto, min, max}. In `min` mode,
            training will stop when the quantity
            monitored has stopped decreasing; in `max`
            mode it will stop when the quantity
            monitored has stopped increasing; in `auto`
            mode, the direction is automatically inferred
            from the name of the monitored quantity.
        baseline: Baseline value for the monitored quantity to reach.
            Training will stop if the model doesn't show improvement
            over the baseline.
        restore_best_weights: whether to restore model weights from
            the epoch with the best value of the monitored quantity.
            If False, the model weights obtained at the last step of
            training are used.

    # Arguments
        min_delta: 最小变化
        patience: 多少个epoch未提高，就停止训练
        verbose: 信息大于，默认打印信息
        mode: 计算模式
        monitor: 计算指标
        baseline: 基线
